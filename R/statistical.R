# H3 Test: Tenure can be predicted from relationship satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by gender. Regression and significance tests, with scatterplot and fit lines. Note that youâ€™ll need to plot predicted values (i.e., marginal effects), not raw data. Include a table of coefficients, t-tests, and p-values only (no SEs), with meaningful labels.

# Publication results for H1
# Monthly pay and performance rating produced the following correlation: `r str_remove(round(cor_test(stat_tbl, MonthlyIncome, PerformanceRating)[[3]], 2), pattern = "^(-)?0")`. This was not a significant relationship at the alpha level of 0.05.
