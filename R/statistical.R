# H2 Test: Monthly pay differs by department. ANOVA and significance tests, with a boxplot split by department. Include a traditional ANOVA summary table (component name, SS, df, MS, F, p).

# H3 Test: Tenure can be predicted from relationship satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by gender. Regression and significance tests, with scatterplot and fit lines. Note that youâ€™ll need to plot predicted values (i.e., marginal effects), not raw data. Include a table of coefficients, t-tests, and p-values only (no SEs), with meaningful labels.

# Visualizations
# H1 scatterplot. There was a perfectly bimodal distribution in performance rating scores, which obfuscated interpretations So I jittered the data. I considered adjusting the y-axis units to dispaly the full range of possible ranking values, but without context on that variable's full scale, I chose to leave the plotted scale as is. For this and all other graphs, I chose to avoid going too far with color to keep it simple and avoid possible challenges to inclusiveness with colorblindness.

# Publication
# Publication results for H1
# Monthly pay and performance ratings produced the following correlation: `r str_remove(round(H1cor$cor, 2), pattern = "^(-)?0")`. This was not a significant relationship at the alpha level of 0.05.

# Publication results for H2
# Monthly pay was found to differ by department: F(`r H2anova$DFn`, `r H2anovaDFd`) = `r format(round(H2anova$F, 2), nsmall = 2)`, p = `r str_remove(round(H2anova$p, 2), pattern = "^(-)?0")`. Tukey's HSD tests indicated that the Research and Development department was paid significantly more than the Sales department.

# Publication results for H3
# Years at the company were not significantly predicted by relationship satisfaction: F(`r H3anova$DFn`, `r H3anova$DFd`) = `r H3anova$F[[3]]`, p = `r str_remove(round(H3anova$p[[3]], 2), pattern = "^(-)?0")`. As a result, post-hoc analyses with Tukey's HSD were not conducted.

# Here are the three publication tables saved according to their hypothesis numbers.
