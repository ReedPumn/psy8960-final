# Analyses
# H1 Test: There is a relationship between monthly pay and performance rating. Correlation and significance test, with a scatterplot and fit line.
cor_test(stat_tbl, MonthlyIncome, PerformanceRating)

# H2 Test: Monthly pay differs by department. ANOVA and significance tests, with a boxplot split by department. Include a traditional ANOVA summary table (component name, SS, df, MS, F, p).
anova_test(stat_tbl, MonthlyIncome ~ Department, detailed = TRUE)
# Post-hoc analyses since the ANOVA was signicicant.
tukey_hsd(stat_tbl, MonthlyIncome ~ Department)

# H3 Test: Tenure can be predicted from relationship satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by gender. Regression and significance tests, with scatterplot and fit lines. Note that youâ€™ll need to plot predicted values (i.e., marginal effects), not raw data. Include a table of coefficients, t-tests, and p-values only (no SEs), with meaningful labels.

# Visualizations
# H1 scatterplot. There was a perfectly bimodal distribution in performance rating scores, which obfuscated interpretations So I jittered the data. I considered adjusting the y-axis units to dispaly the full range of possible ranking values, but without context on that variable's full scale, I chose to leave the plotted scale as is. For this and all other graphs, I chose to avoid going too far with color to keep it simple and avoid possible challenges to inclusiveness with colorblindness.

# Publication
# Publication results for H1
# Monthly pay and performance rating produced the following correlation: `r str_remove(round(cor_test(stat_tbl, MonthlyIncome, PerformanceRating)[[3]], 2), pattern = "^(-)?0")`. This was not a significant relationship at the alpha level of 0.05.
